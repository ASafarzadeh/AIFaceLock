> Complete No IRSENSOR needed AI Screen Recognizer With 90+% Of Correct Recognition

## What FreezeWall Does

1. Capture about 200 pics from the owner and learn from them
2. Apply Security Layers and Usese Neural Network Learning Based On Harcascade
3. When Starts, Locks the Computer Completely while The Owner(s)'s Face is not recognized.

> _‚ö† Cause This Program Doesn't Need Any IR SENSOR and Just uses a simple webcam, It Won't Work in low Light_
